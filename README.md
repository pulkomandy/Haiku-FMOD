Haiku-FMOD
==========

This is an FMOD API-compatible library for Haiku.

FMOD is a closed source library used by many games and other software to manage
sound effects. This is sometimes a problem when porting those to Haiku.

This library is very, very incomplete. It was custom-built to implement exactly
what was needed to get RetroSpec's Alien 8 remake to play music. Don't expect
too much from it.

However, support for other functions can be added and the code improved as we
need it. The next step is getting tracked music formats support so I can use it
in Deflektor X4 (also from Retrospec).
